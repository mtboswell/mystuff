We want to be able to use the most convenient library for each API, so each adapter will be an independent binary that interfaces via stdin/stdout.

It will accept on stdin a query or edit, and produce data object on stdout. I'm thinking of using Cap'n Proto for the object representation.

What sort of query language? SQL? Too complicated. Need something like:
	GET <url>
	PUT <url> <diff>
	LIST <url-prefix>
So GET returns a data object, PUT accepts a binary data object diff
List returns all available URLs or just a subset if provided with a prefix

URLs look something like imaps://messagingengine.com/micah@bswll.net/INBOX/...
Better example: facebook://micahboswell/posts/23k4l23k4j
Mapping:	facebook:// --> facebook adapter
		micahboswell --> username
		posts --> post object type
		23k4l23k4j --> facebook object ID
