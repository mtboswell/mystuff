	Tried clang (takes >12GB disk to build), tried castxml (doesn't work on .h), now 
		trying doxygen to extract an AST from header files
	Testing it on a project that uses doxygen (apr 1.5.2-5) via the debian source package
		(which is how I intend to get sources or headers and binaries from the same 
		place)
	apt-get source libapr1
	Are the doxygen comments in the headers from the dev package?
	apt-get install libapr1-dev
	yes they appear to be
	now how to generate doxygen docs from there?
	BTW need to copy my dotfiles from bach or wherever
	Copied doxygen.conf from apr source and added GENERATE_XML=YES and changed 
		INPUT to INPUT=/usr/include/apr-1.0 and changed OUTPUT_DIRECTORY to .
	Needed to copy theirs because it has fun macro stuff.
	Turns out doxygen works just fine with the -dev headers.
	APR is a C lib.
	APR doxygen.conf also available from 
		http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr/tags/1.5.2/docs/doxygen.conf
